# MAEL Phrases

"MAEL Phrases" (Multi-App pour l'Aide à l'Enseignement des Langues : multi app for language teaching assistance) allows teachers to put their students in the position of being able to create phrases.

## Principle of operation
The learner has access to a library of images organised by category. Each category is organised into several themes.

### To listen to words

Each image is associated with a word (according to the chosen language). The student listens to a word by clicking on it.

### To create sentences

The student drags and drops images into an area to create a sentence. When finished, he presses a button and a sentence is generated (most likely). Then the application pronounces the sentence.

## The different languages

MAEL Phrase is literally a manager of image libraries associated with word dictionaries. The application can work mainly in 9 languages:

* French French
* French Canadian
* Spanish (Spain)
* Central American Spanish
* English (England)
* American English
* Portuguese Portuguese from Portugal
* Brazilian Portuguese
* Simplified Chinese)

### Types of students targeted:

* Pre-school students learning one of these 9 languages.
* Any student (primary, secondary or other educational institution) starting to learn one of these 9 languages.
* Children with a syndrome that does not allow them to access spoken language (e.g. profound Asperger's, etc.).
